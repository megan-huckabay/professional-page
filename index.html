            <h2>Things I enjoy in my spare time!</h2>

            <h3>Pour Painting with My Stepdaughter:</h3>

            <p>
                I have a special bond with my stepdaughter, and one of our favorite activities together is pour painting.<br>
                For those unfamiliar with this art form, it's a delightful blend of acrylic paints, pouring medium, and a touch of silicone, all mixed in a single cup.<br>
                This colorful concoction is then poured onto a canvas and carefully manipulated by tilting it back and forth. There are numerous techniques, each resulting in its own unique masterpiece.<br>
                It's a messy affair, but the joy it brings is absolutely worth it!
            </p>

            <h3>Extending a Helping Hand:</h3>

            <p>
                One of my greatest joys is reaching out to those in need.<br>
                I believe in the power of a simple act of kindness.<br>
                It starts with gathering essentials like loaves of bread, chips, and bottled water, using them to prepare a batch of wholesome sandwiches.<br>
                I then head into town, seeking out homeless encampments to distribute these bagged lunches.<br>
                Additionally, if there are any leftovers from our family dinners, I make it a point to share them with those who could use a warm meal.<br>
                It's not just about providing sustenance, but also about connecting with fellow human beings in a compassionate and dignified way.
            </p>

            <h3>Embracing Nature's Beauty:</h3>

            <p>
                Nature, in all its magnificent forms, holds a special place in my heart.<br>
                Whether it's a scorching day or the heavens open up in a downpour, I find solace and boundless inspiration in its ever-changing beauty.<br>
                From vibrant sunsets to the tranquil rustling of leaves, every moment in nature is a reminder of the wonders that surround us.
            </p>

            <h3>Unleashing the Power of Code:</h3>

            <p>
                Recently, I've been captivated by the world of coding.<br>
                It's a new passion that I'm eager to explore further. Learning one language is just the beginning<br>
                I'm excited about the prospect of diving into a multitude of coding languages.<br>
                It's like unlocking a secret language that opens up endless possibilities in the digital realm.<br>
                This webpage is a testament to my progress, with more exciting projects on the horizon.

            <p>
                In this project, I built a robust API with CRUD functionality for managing projects and actions.<br>
                I implemented NPM scripts for seamless server execution, consumed environment variables for flexibility, and organized endpoints using Express Routers.<br>
                Additionally, I created middleware functions for enhanced functionality and leveraged database models for efficient data persistence.<br>
                The project adheres to best practices and includes comprehensive testing and documentation
            </p>

            <a href="https://github.com/meggers1990/web-module-project-testing-react.git">TESTING-REACT</a>
            <p>
                In this project, I focused on testing React components related to displaying TV show data.<br>
                I followed a structured approach, starting with project setup and dependency installation.<br>
                Then, I tested the Episode component by passing in different props and verifying the rendered output.<br>
                Next, I worked on testing the Show component, including scenarios with mock data and event handling.<br>
                Lastly, I tackled testing the display component, handling async operations and mocking external modules.<br>
                I also completed optional stretch goals, adding a testing suite for the episodes component and incorporating features like fetching data for different shows.<br>
                Overall, the project emphasized thorough testing and effective use of React testing libraries.

            <p>
                I am deeply passionate about embarking on a career in technology, and I am eager to align myself with companies that share my values of continuous growth and learning.<br>
                My immediate goal is to secure an entry-level position within a forward-thinking organization that places a strong emphasis on career progression and offers ample opportunities for skill development.
            </p>
            <p>
                After gaining a solid foundation and honing my skills for about a year, I aspire to take on a role as a learner's assistant at BloomTech.<br>
                This role speaks to my desire to give back and support others in their journey into the world of development.<br>
                Guiding and mentoring fellow enthusiasts is a fulfilling prospect that I believe will not only contribute to their growth but also enhance my own understanding of the field.
            </p>

                Looking ahead, I am excited to expand my horizons and explore new technologies.<br>

                My ultimate aspiration is to contribute to groundbreaking projects, and I see organizations like Tesla, at the forefront of innovation, as the perfect environment to bring my vision to life.<br>
                The intersection of technology and artificial intelligence is a realm I am particularly drawn to, and I am driven to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of this dynamic field.

            <h2>Whats In My Distant future Plans!!</h2>
            <p>
                As I look ahead to the distant future, my drive to make a difference burns brighter than ever.<br>
                I'm dedicated to being a guiding force for young adults struggling with addiction and homelessness, offering them not just a helping hand, but a chance at a future filled with recovery, stability, and hope.<br>
                In the years to come, I see the birth of an organization that doesn't just provide immediate aid, but empowers with purpose.<br>
                This means giving them more than just jobs, but the skills they need to thrive, creating a strong foundation for their professional journeys.<br>
                I'm also committed to creating programs that help the homeless transition into homes of their own, marking a significant step towards independence.<br>
                My vision extends beyond practical assistance.<br>
                I long for a world where compassion outweighs judgment, and understanding replaces stereotypes.<br>
                Through open conversations, breaking down biases, and advocating for widespread education, I hope to spark a movement towards a society that actively uplifts those in need.<br>               
                In this future, I envision a collective effort against homelessness, uniting people from all walks of life.<br>
                Together, we'll share stories of transformation, showcasing the incredible potential within each individual.<br>
                This isn't just about providing relief; it's about planting the seeds for a sustained, inclusive society, where homelessness is but a distant memory.
