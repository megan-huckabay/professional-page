This project consists of three main files:

## HTML File: `index.html`

- Defines the structure and content of the webpage.
- Starts with the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, indicating that this is an HTML5 document.
- Contains the `<html>` element, which is the root element that contains all other elements on the page.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata about the document, including character set, viewport settings, title, and links to external resources like CSS files.
- The `<body>` section contains the main content of the webpage.
- Inside the `<body>`, there is a `<header>` element for the header section, followed by various `<div>` elements with class "section-container" containing `<section>` elements. These sections have unique IDs like "aboutMe", "education", etc.
- There's a comment section (`<div id="comment-section">`) and a footer (`<footer>`).
- At the end of the file, there's a link to an external JavaScript file (`<script src="script.js"></script>`).

## CSS File: `styles.css`

- Provides styles for the webpage.
- Starts with comments describing what each section of styles is for.
- Each section targets specific HTML elements or elements with specific IDs or classes and applies styles to them.
- For example, `body { ... }` applies styles to the entire body of the webpage, `header { ... }` applies styles to the header, and `#aboutMe { ... }` applies styles to the element with ID "aboutMe".
- There are styles for buttons and comments as well.

## JavaScript File: `script.js`

- Contains functions that add interactivity to the webpage.
- `scrollToSection(sectionId)` scrolls the page smoothly to a section with a specified ID.
- `addComment()` retrieves a comment from an input field, creates a new comment element, and appends it to the comments container.
- `clearComments()` clears all comments from the comments container.
- These JavaScript functions are called from the HTML file when certain buttons are clicked.
